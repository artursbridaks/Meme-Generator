**Meme Generator**

The project developed during the bootcamp front-end, Vue course. A fun page which allows the user to create their own meme.

**Instructions**

To open the project, clone it to your local machine. Open the terminal in the root folder and write the following commands:

* npm install
* npm run serve (open the local server)

**Description**

The program was developed using Visual Studio Code and a Vue framework. The pictures in the site are fetched from a public library. The main function of the site is the editor where you can add your own text to the image, position it with a drag & drop function, resize it, change the opacity and in the end, of course, download your creation.

**Commentary**

The timeframe for the project was quite short. Still, I managed to complete all the basic functionality which was previously defined by the lecturer. If more time was given, I would have improved the core functionality and improved the quality of the code.
